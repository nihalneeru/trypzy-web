# Trypzy Logo Assets

## Logo File Placement

Place the Trypzy logo file here as:
- `trypzy-logo.png` (or `trypzy-logo.svg`)

## Logo Usage Rules

- Use the logo file as the ONLY logo source
- Do NOT recolor, distort, rotate, crop, stretch, or add effects
- Do NOT add shadows, gradients, outlines, or filters
- Preserve original aspect ratio
- Maintain clear space around the logo

## Favicon/App Icon Generation

To create favicon and app icon files:
1. Use the logo file (`trypzy-logo.png`) as the source
2. Generate:
   - `app/icon.png` (for Next.js App Router)
   - `app/favicon.ico` or `app/favicon.png`
3. Keep transparency intact
4. Do not invent new logo variants
